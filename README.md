# HW03PasswordGenerator
Homework 3 for my bootcamp class

My motivation for finding new information is testing the various java tools that I had been refreshed on this past week. My reason for building the project was wanting to reinforce these tools I had learned and to show that I knew what I was doing. The problem that was solved with this assignment was me utilizing loops, if statements, and basic knowledge of code to output a randomly generated password given some conditions specified by the user.

I wouldn't say I had learned anything new while making this, but I will say it did help reinforce the basics in things I wasn't 100% on like random number generation and iterating through a string.

I think the main difference between my project and others would be using string based iteration instead of maybe array based iteration as well as how I threw some exceptions in a basic sense by eliminating a lot of possible inputs.
